# MyRaspberryPiAdblocker

## GENERAL
 This is one way to make your own adblocker for you network, by using one raspberry pi and pi-hole.
 
 Pi-hole is a network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application for Linux which acts as a DNS sinkhole intended for use on a private network. It is designed for low-power embedded devices with network capability, focusing on the Raspberry Pi as its 'reference' hardware platform.
 
 In my case i choose to work with Raspberry pi zero which cost about 10$.
